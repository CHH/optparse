# Optparse â€” Another Command Line Argument Parser

## Install

1\. Get [composer](http://getcomposer.org).

2\. Put this into your local `composer.json`:
```
{
  "require": {
    "chh/optparse": "*@dev"
  }
}
```

3\. `php composer.phar install`

## Use

There are two things you will define in the parser:

 - _Flags_, arguments which start with one or two dashes and are
   considered as options of your program.
 - _Arguments_, everything else which is not a flag.

The main point of interest is the `CHH\Optparse\Parser`, which you can
use to define _Flags_ and _Arguments_.

### Flags

To define a flag, pass the flag's name to the `addFlag` method:

```php
<?php

$parser = new CHH\Optparse\Parser;

$parser->addFlag("help");
$parser->parse();

if ($parser["help"]) {
    echo $parser->usage();
    exit;
}
```

A flag defined with `addFlag` is by default available as `--$flagName`.
To define another name (e.g. a short name) for the flag, pass it as the
value of the `alias` option in the options array:

```php
<?php
$parser->addFlag("help", ["alias" => "-h"]);
```

This way the `help` flag is available as `--help` _and_ `-h`.

Flags don't expect values following them by default. To turn this on set the flag's `has_value` option
to `true`:

```php
<?php

$parser->addFlag("name", ["has_value" => true]);
$parser->parse(['--name', 'John']);

echo "Hello World {$parser["name"]}!\n";
```

The parser also supports callbacks for flags. These are passed to
`addFlag` as last argument. The callback is called everytime the parser
encounters the flag. It gets passed a reference to the flag's value (`true` if it
hasn't one). Use cases for this include splitting a string in pieces or
running a method when a flag is passed:

```php
<?php

$parser = new Parser;

function usage_and_exit()
{
    global $parser;
    echo $parser->usage(), "\n";
    exit;
}

$parser->addFlag("help", ['alias' => '-h'], "usage_and_exit");

$parser->addFlag("queues", ["has_value" => true], function(&$value) {
    $value = explode(',', $value);
});
```

The call to `parse` takes an array of arguments, or falls back to using
the arguments from `$\_SERVER['argv']`. The `parse` method throws an
`CHH\Optparse\ArgumentException` when a required flag or argument is missing, so make
sure to catch this Exception and provide the user with a nice error
message.

The parser is also able to generate a usage message for the command by
looking at the defined flags and arguments. Use the `usage` method to
retrieve it.

### Named Arguments

Named arguments can be added by using the `addArgument` method, which
takes the argument's name as first argument and then an array of
options.

As opposed to flags, the order **matters** in which you define your
arguments.

Variable length arguments can be defined by setting the `var_arg` option
to `true` in the options array. Variable arguments can only be at the
last position, and arguments defined after an variable argument are
never set.

```php
<?php

$parser->addArgument("files", ["var_arg" => true]);

// Will always be null, because the value will be consumed by the
// "var_arg" enabled argument.
$parser->addArgument("foo");

$parser->parse(["foo", "bar", "baz"]);

foreach ($parser["files"] as $file) {
    echo $file, "\n";
}
// Output:
// foo
// bar
// baz
```
